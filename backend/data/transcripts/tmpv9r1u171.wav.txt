 Are you not entertained? And this is what you think of us? Oh, temporary. Oh, Morris. Salwate. Minerva here is steamed, Roman goddess of reason, wisdom, handicrafts and war. It's come to my attention that many of you have been thinking about ancient Rome. A lot. But how much do you really know? I'll be the judge. Let's play a little game I like to call, duo Veda et mindakeum, or to the rest of you to truth in a lie. Let's meet our three brave contestants. And let's show them what they're playing for. An all-expense paid cruise aboard one of colligulas pleasure barges, prepared to be wind and dined on a trip you'll never forget. Well, you'll probably forget. As for the losers, the die is cast, prepared to spot the lie. A. Gladiators had their own guilds. B. Most gladiatorial fights ended before anyone died. B. Gladiators were from an enslaved class. And I thought this was an easy one. It's true that from their introduction around the third century BC-E, Roman gladiators were often enslaved or convicted criminals. But this changed by the first century CE. After the opening of the Coliseum in ADCE, Freeman and former soldiers began signing up for a life in the arena, lured by the potential for fame and regular employment. They even formed their own guilds, which organized funerals and provided tensions for gladiators' families if they were to die. But it took a lot of time and money to train a gladiator. So it wouldn't make any sense to have them fighting to the death. At least not all the time. Moving on to Session. A. The Togo was the cornerstone of Daily Roman Dress. B. Many Roman women wore dresses made with Chinese silk. C. Uren was the primary laundry detergent for Roman clothes. While male Roman citizens did wear Togo's, they were strictly for ceremonial and official events. And they were worn over clothing like tunics, never on their own. That would be indecent. As indecent as some writers called the Flimsy Chinese silk dresses that became fashionable amongst upper-class Roman women in the first century CE. And finally, the ammonia in urine does indeed make for an excellent, stained-fitting solution. Which is why Roman launders often placed buckets on street corners to collect the urine of passers by. That reminds me. Next question. A. Many Roman homes featured a wanitorium, a room where people could vomit after overindulging. B. The Pythagorean's who followed the teachings of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, embraced a vegetarian diet. C. A favorite Roman condiment was saws made from fermented fish guts. While vomit and wanitoria come from the same root meaning to spew forth, a wanitorium is simply a passage through which spectators spewed from amphitheaters or rena's into the street. Purching was a common medical treatment, but it certainly wasn't prescribed to make room for more fish guts or sauce. As for Pythagoras, there were more than three sides to the man I'll have you know. He was a philosopher and his followers embraced his belief that eating animal flesh increased aggressive behavior. We're all tied up, but this last question is sure to separate the true Romano files from the Romano flakes. A. The city of Rome was sacked twice during the 5th century CE. B. The last western Roman emperor was Romulus Augustulus. C. The Roman Empire fell in 476 CE. Just as I thought, the very idea that Rome fell is complicated. It's true that by 476 the Empire looked very different. By the 4th century it had permanently split into eastern and western halves, each with its own emperor. The last emperor in the west, Romulus Augustulus, was overthrown in 476 CE in a military coup. But the Germanic general who replaced him didn't make sweeping changes. Roman political and cultural life endured and military conquest continued. At least until the eastern emperor Justinian led a devastating invasion of Italy in the 530s. In the east, the Roman Empire survived for a thousand years, becoming what you now call the Byzantine Empire. That makes contestant number three are big winner. Enjoy the spoils. As for our losers, better luck next time. Here's hoping there is one. Ready to keep playing? Why not try your hand at a TED game?
