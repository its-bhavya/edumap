 We can define the French Revolution as a social and political conflict that broke out in France in 1789. It pitted the privileged groups against the underprivileged. This event was the beginning of the end of the old regime in Europe, as we have explained in previous videos. Nobody disputes that the French Revolution was much more important than any other revolution of its contemporaries, but why? First of all, it happened in France, the largest, most powerful, and most populous state in Europe. The French Revolution was also a social revolution since groups such as women, sands-colottes, peasants, and the bourgeoisie participated. They all shared one goal, freedom or death. Also, it was the most radical. In addition to the executions of the royal family, 50,000 people were executed during these years. Finally, it was a universal revolution since his ideas spread throughout Europe, America, and Asia. For all this, we can conclude that the conflict between the old regime and the new social order was more exact, representative, and sharp in France than anywhere else. Finally, the classic stages of the French Revolution are the constitutional monarchy, the First French Republic, and the Napoleonic stage.
